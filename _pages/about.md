I am currently a Research Assistant at the Suliman S. Olayan School of Business and the Center for Advanced Mathematical Sciences at the American University of Beirut (AUB). I work under [Dr. Victor Araman](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~varaman/) in the discipline of Operations Research. Before that, I was a graduate student in the Department of Mathematics at AUB. I did my Master's Thesis with [Dr. Wissam Raji](https://www.aub.edu.lb/pages/profile.aspx?MemberId=wr07) on certain topics in the theory of Modular Forms.

I have fairly broad research interests, scattered around Number Theory and its allied areas.
