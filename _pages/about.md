I am currently a Research Assistant in the Olayan School of Business at the American University of Beirut (AUB). I work under Dr. [Victor Araman](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~varaman/) in Decision Systems. Before that, I was a graduate student in the Department of Mathematics at AUB; where I did my Master's Thesis with Dr. [Wissam Raji](https://www.aub.edu.lb/pages/profile.aspx?MemberId=wr07) on certain topics in the theory of Modular Forms.

I have fairly broad research interests, scattered around Number Theory and its allied areas.
