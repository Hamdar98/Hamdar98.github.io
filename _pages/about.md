I am currently a PhD student in the [Montreal Number Theory Group](https://montrealnumbertheory.org/). My advisor is [Chantal David](http://mypage.concordia.ca/mathstat/cdavid/). Before that, I was at the American University of Beirut where I worked with [Kamal Khuri-Makdisi](https://sites.aub.edu.lb/kmakdisi/) and [Wissam Raji](https://www.aub.edu.lb/pages/profile.aspx?memberID=wr07).
