## I am currently a Research Assistant at the Suliman S. Oliyan School of Business and the Center for Advanced Mathematical Sciences at the American University of Beirut (AUB). I work under Dr. Victor Araman in the discipline of Operations Research. Before that, I was a graduate student in the Department of Mathematics at AUB. I did my Master's Thesis with Dr. Wissam Raji on certain topics in the theory of Modular Forms.
